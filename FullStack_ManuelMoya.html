    <h2>Re:Eileen Dover university application</h2>
    
  
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part<br> of your PhD next year.
     I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Starting dates</h3>
       We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
       <br>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <span>Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.</span>
        <span>You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.</span>

    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>

    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>             
         the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued   <br> 
          by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br>
             audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <span>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>    
         research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? fall.

      <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
             my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Polynesian chicken dance <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.
        </p>
        <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modem styles such as Twerking.
        </p>
        <p>Arctic robot dance <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they were really cold.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p> Yours sincerely.</p>
