Re: Eileen Dover university application

<div>
Dear Eileen,
    <br>
    <br>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part <br>
of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
</div>
<h3>
    Starting dates 
</h3>
<p>
    We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
     could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
    First semester: 9 September 2016
</li>
<li>
    Second semester: 15 January 2017
</li>
<li>
    Third semester 2 May 2017
</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>
    Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.
</p>
<p>
    You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.  
</p>
<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
<p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>
    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
    by are as follows, in order of priority:    
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br>
         audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sub>3</sub> > 3 x 10<sub>4</sub>.)
    </li>
    <li>
        HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
         research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
<h3>
    Exotic dance moves
</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
         <br>
        <dl><br>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around<br>
        in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</dd>
    </dl> 
    <dl>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably<br> 
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
        modem styles such as Twerking.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
        because they were really cold.</dd>
    </dl>
        <br>
        For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page</a>.
        <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
